<p>This is a simple graphical user interface for <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">Neovim</a> (an
aggressively refactored and updated Vim editor). Where possible there are some graphical
improvements, but functionally it should act like the terminal UI.</p>
<p>To checkout all the <strong>cool features</strong>, <strong>installation instructions</strong>, <strong>configuration settings</strong> and
much more, head on over to <a href="https://neovide.dev">neovide.dev</a>.</p>

<h2>Author Notes</h2>
<p>I've been using this as my daily driver since November 2019. It should be relatively stable, but I'm
still working out some kinks and ironing out some cross platform issues. In general it should be
usable at this point, and if it isn't I consider that a bug and appreciate a report in the issues!
Any help and ideas are also greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm also very interested in suggestions code quality/style wise when it comes to Rust. I'm pretty
new to the language and appreciate any critiques that you might have to offer. I won't take all of
them, but I promise to consider anything you might have to offer.</p>
